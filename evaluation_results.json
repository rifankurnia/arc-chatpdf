According to Reuters, OpenAI has entered into a strategic partnership with Britain to deepen collaboration on AI security research and explore investing in British AI. This suggests a significant expansion of OpenAI's global collaborations.\n\nIn addition, WIRED reports that OpenAI is seeking additional capital from investors as part of a $40 billion funding round. This indicates that the company is looking to significantly increase its resources and capabilities.\n\nOpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has also been vocal about the potential misuse of AI technology. As reported by The Independent and TechCrunch, Altman has warned about the risks of AI fraud and the lack of legal confidentiality when using AI systems like ChatGPT as a therapist.\n\nFurthermore, OpenAI has announced its DevDay 2025, as per the company's official news page. This event is likely to showcase the latest developments and future plans of the company.\n\nLastly, TechCrunch reports that Meta has appointed Shengjia Zhao as the chief scientist of its AI superintelligence unit. While this news is not directly about OpenAI, it is relevant to the broader AI research community that OpenAI is a part of.\n\nPlease note that the dates of these developments are not specified in the search results.

It incorporates the advantages of previous datasets like Spider and KaggleDBQA. It is the first to be curated for evaluating SQL execution efficiency in large-scale databases [Source: Zhang et al. - 2024, Page: 3].\n\n2. BigTable-0.2k: This is a novel dataset constructed by the authors, which is an extension and augmentation of the BIRD dataset [Source: Zhang et al. - 2024, Page: 4].\n\n3. WikiSQL: This is considered the first large-scale dataset enabling the training and evaluation of learning-based Text-to-SQL methods. It is also known as a cross-domain dataset [Source: Zhang et al. - 2024, Page: 2].\n\n4. KaggleDBQA: This is a cross-domain dataset extracted from Kaggle and features real-world databases taken from the Web. It also includes documentation and metadata for its databases [Source: Katsogiannis-Meimarakis and Koutrika - 2023, Page: 4].\n\n5. Spider: This is a cross-domain dataset with complex SQLs [Source: Zhang et al. - 2024, Page: 3].\n\n6. GeoQuery: This dataset was used in the evaluation of the finetuned T5 model [Source: Rajkumar et al. - 2022, Page: 3].\n\n7. Scholar: This dataset was also used in the evaluation of the finetuned T5 model [Source: Rajkumar et al. - 2022, Page: 3].\n\n8. IMDb: This is a domain-specific text-to-SQL dataset focusing on movies and television series [Source: Katsogiannis-Meimarakis and Koutrika - 2023, Page: 3].\n\nPlease note that the last two datasets (GeoQuery and Scholar) were mentioned in a different document and might not be directly related to the main research paper by Zhang et al.",
